ABOUT                                               *tabws-about*
This vim/neovim plugin allows you to treat tabs as 'project workspaces'. It allows 
you to have multiple projects open in a single vim instance, and to switch between 
them easily. This is much better than having multiple vim instances open in various 
tmux/shell windows.

In particular, TabWS does the following:
  - Automatically determines project-root (using [vim-projectroot](https://github.com/dbakker/vim-projectroot)) when opening a  file. If the project-root is already open in a tab, it associated the new buffer with that 'project' tab. If the project is not open, a new tab is created to hold it.
  - Switches the current working directory to the project-root when you switch to a given tab.
  - Maintains separate tag-stacks for each project, so you can easily navigate via ctrl-]/ctrl-T in each project independently.
  - Shows the project name (i.e. the project-root name) in the tabline.
  - Replaces the :buffers, :ls commands to allow listing only the buffers associated with a given project tab.
  - Replaces the :buffer command to jump to the buffer in it's existing tab. Autocomplete of buffer names is only from those associated with the current tab.
  - Hooks into [fzf.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim) to make its Buffers command only display buffers from the current tab. (Requires [this](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim/pull/831) pull request).
  - Adds a Tabs fzf command which lists the available tab projects for quick jumping between them.

USAGE                                               *tabws-usage*

TabWS should just work. Opening files should automatically either create a new 
project tab, or associate the new buffer with the correct project tab.

Listing buffers with :buffers, :ls or Fzf's Buffers command should show only the
buffers for the current project tab.
